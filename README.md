# Welcome to my Ice Sheet Simulator

This is a program based on the "Simple I-D Ice Sheet Flow Model" that is a part of the "Global Warming II: Create You Own Models in Python" Coursera course, provided by the University of Chicago.

This main output of this program is a moving pseudo-bell curve graph that simulates the elevation-growth of a sheet of ice on a 1000000 meter-wide (1-dimensional) patch of flat ground. 

The simulated ground is flanked by two patches of water (not unlike a larger landmass like Greenland), and it gains its ice from 0.5 of "snowfall" per year. As the ice accrues in the simulation, an "ice hill" develops based on continous snowfall raising the elevation of settled ice, and ice slowly "flows" downhill into the surrounding water (as dictated by a flow constant, etc.).

The main point of this program is to give a sped-up and simplified visual of the specific way that ice accrues, and flows down itself.

## What the program does, in simple terms

Twelve "grid centers" (or points) are set up with the "nGridCenters" variable, and the 

Have fun using the program!
